# Testing and Refactoring Kata

This project is based off of [sandromancuso's trip-service-kata git repo](https://github.com/sandromancuso/trip-service-kata). The project is meant to resemble a legacy project which needs refactoring. 

A [Kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata) is an exercise to help practice a certain skill, in this case: testing and refactoring.
